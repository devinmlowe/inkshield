What is an InkShield?
 This shield allows you to connect a HP C6602 inkjet cartridge to your Arduino turning it into a 96dpi print platform.  It only uses 5 pins which can be jumper selected to avoid other shields.  It is designed with a Arduino Mega footprint but fully supports both the Arduino and the Arduino Mega.  It is designed with all through-hole components to make assembly easy even for beginners.


Features
 Compatible with Arduino and Arduino Mega
 Uses only 5 user selectable pins
 Stackable (up to 11 Inkshields on Ardunio, 15 on Mega)
 On-board 18.5V boost converter for Inkjet head
 Accepts 9-12V input via optional power connector or from the Vin of the Arduino
 Auxiliary input header offers support for other microcontrollers 
 Auxiliary output header supports an extension cable to the inkjet head
 Power and Pulse activity LEDs
 ISCP header and Reset button
 All through-hole components


Release Information
 The Schematics and PCB layout are Kicad format files
 The libraries are all for Arduino (with support for Arduino and Arduino Mega)
